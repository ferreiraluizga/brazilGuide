                            Welcome to Brazil! Whether you're here for a brief visit or a longer stay, there are
                            several key steps and tips to help you smoothly navigate your arrival and maximize your time
                            in this vibrant and diverse country. From practical advice on handling entry formalities to
                            insights on making the most of your Brazilian adventure, this guide will set you off on the
                            right foot. Here's what you need to know to get started:
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>1. Clear Customs and Immigration</h4>
                        <p>
                            After landing, your first stop will be at customs and immigration. Be sure to have all
                            necessary documents ready: <br>

                            <strong>Passport:</strong> Ensure it's valid for at least six months from your date of
                            entry. <br>
                            <strong>Visa:</strong> Check if you need a visa for Brazil and have it ready if required.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Customs Declaration:</strong> Fill out the customs declaration form provided on the
                            plane or at the
                            airport.
                        </p>
                        <h4>2. Currency Exchange</h4>
                        <p>
                            Brazil's official currency is the Brazilian Real (BRL). You can exchange money at the
                            airport, but for better rates, consider doing it at a bank or an authorized exchange office
                            in the city. Most major cities also have ATMs that accept international cards.
                        </p>
                        <h4>3. Getting a SIM Card</h4>
                        <p>
                            Stay connected by purchasing a local SIM card. Major providers like Vivo, TIM, Claro, and Oi
                            offer prepaid SIM cards with various data plans. You can buy these at the airport, mobile
                            shops, or convenience stores. Make sure your phone is unlocked to use a Brazilian SIM.
                        </p>
