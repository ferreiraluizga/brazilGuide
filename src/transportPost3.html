                            In São Paulo, mastering the public transportation system is crucial for both local residents
                            and visitors. With an <strong>integrated system of subway, trains, and buses</strong>, the
                            city offers a
                            robust infrastructure that facilitates daily commuting and quick access to various parts of
                            the metropolis.
                            <br>
                            <strong>São Paulo boasts one of Brazil's most complex and extensive public transportation
                                systems</strong>.
                            The subway, with its colorful lines, extensively connects the city and serves as the
                            backbone of urban mobility. Spanning over 100 km, São Paulo's subway includes strategic
                            stations that enable efficient integration with other modes of transportation such as buses
                            and trains.
                            <br>
                            <strong>The CPTM (Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos) complements the system with
                                its train
                                lines</strong>, covering areas further from downtown São Paulo and providing essential
                            connections to
                            neighboring municipalities. <strong>Buses complete the network</strong>, covering virtually
                            the entire city
                            and its outskirts with routes ranging from exclusive lanes to local paths, offering
                            affordable and varied transportation options.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Integration between Buses, Subways, and Trains in São Paulo</h4>
                        <p>The <strong>Bilhete Único</strong> card is the cornerstone of São Paulo's integrated
                            transport system. This
                            rechargeable card can be used across buses, metro, and trains, allowing seamless transfers
                            without needing separate tickets. With the Bilhete Único, you pay a single fare for multiple
                            transfers within a certain time period. For instance, a single fare covers transfers between
                            buses, metro, and trains if completed within two hours. Major stations like Sé and Barra
                            Funda serve as hubs where you can easily switch between different modes of transport,
                            facilitating efficient and quick transfers. This integration offers cost savings,
                            convenience, and broader accessibility, making it easier to travel across São Paulo.
                            Understanding this system and using the Bilhete Único card can greatly improve your
                            commuting experience in the city.</p>
